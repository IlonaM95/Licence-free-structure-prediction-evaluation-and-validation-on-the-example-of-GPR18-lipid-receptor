The GPR18 receptor, often referred to as the N-arachidonylglycine receptor, although assigned (along with GPR55 and GPR119) to the new class A GPCR subfamily-lipid receptors, officially still has the status of a class A GPCR orphan. While its signaling pathways and biological significance have not yet been fully elucidated, increasing evidence points to the therapeutic potential of GPR18 in relation to immune, neurodegenerative, and cancer processes to name a few. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the interactions of potential ligands with the receptor and the influence of particular structural elements on their activity. Thus, given the lack of an experimentally solved structure, the goal of the present study was to obtain a homology model of the GPR18 receptor in the inactive state, meeting all requirements in terms of protein structure quality and recognition of active ligands. To increase the reliability and precision of the predictions, different contemporary protein structure prediction methods and software were used and compared herein. To test the usability of the resulting models, we optimized and compared the selected structures followed by the assessment of the ability to recognize known, active ligands. The stability of the predicted poses was then evaluated by means of molecular dynamics simulations. On the other hand, most of the best-ranking contemporary CADD software/platforms for its full usability require rather expensive licenses. To overcome this down-to-earth obstacle, the overarching goal of these studies was to test whether it is possible to perform the thorough CADD experiments with high scientific confidence while using only license-free/academic software and online platforms. The obtained results indicate that a wide range of freely available software and/or academic licenses allow us to carry out meaningful molecular modelling/docking studies.
